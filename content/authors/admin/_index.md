abstract: >
  We present a Virtual Element Method (VEM) based framework for 
  embedded fluid-solid coupling on irregular polyhedral meshes. 
  Our approach enables high-fidelity and interactive simulation 
  in complex virtual environments, supporting robust coupling 
  between deformable solids and incompressible fluids.
